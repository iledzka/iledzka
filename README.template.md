# 👋 Hi, I’m Iza

I'm a software developer who enjoys building beautiful user interfaces. I specialise in React Native with ES6 and TypeScript.

- ⚙️ I’m interested in creating apps that feel intuitive, performant and with great attention to detail.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about and experimenting with animations using [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) and [Skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia)
