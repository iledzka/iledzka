## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Iza

I'm a software developer who enjoys building beautiful user interfaces. I specialise in React Native with ES6 and TypeScript.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating apps that feel intuitive, snappy and have great attention to details.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning animations with [Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) and [Skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia)
